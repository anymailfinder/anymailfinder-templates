subject: Can you put me in touch with [decision maker]?
text: |
  Hey [name],

  Was hoping that you might be able to introduce me to [decision maker] at [department]?

  I wanted to connect with him because our email lists target a similar demographic
  with limited overlap. Seeing our products are non-competitive, I wanted to
  touch base to see if he was up for brainstorming ways to leverage our existing
  user bases to grow both of our lists.

  We did this with [competitor] in the past, and both parties received a 15% lift in new subscribers.

  Any help is much appreciated.
