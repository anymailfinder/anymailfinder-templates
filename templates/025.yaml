  I hope I didn’t freak you out by my subject line, but I’m really in love with you. Don’t worry, it’s not in a creepy way. What I mean is I’m in love with your website [company].

  You probably get tons of people everyday who are in love with [company], so I won’t bore you with my reasons. Instead, I thought I could show you some appreciation by giving you some feedback on how you can improve your website.

  Insert suggestion #1
  Insert suggestion #2
  And if you are wondering how you can repay your biggest fan, feel free to link to my website [my website]. ;-)

  Ah… just kidding, you’ve already done enough for me by making [company] so awesome!

  Cheers,
  [my name]

  PS: If you do happen to link to my website [my website], it will seriously make my year! Maybe even decade!
