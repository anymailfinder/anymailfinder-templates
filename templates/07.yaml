  Hey [name],

  Was hoping that you might be able to introduce me to [decision maker] at [area]?

  I wanted to connect with him because our email list targets a similar demographic with limited overlap. Seeing as our products are non-competitive, I wanted to touch base to see if he was up for brainstorming ways to leverage our existing user bases to grow both of our lists.

  We did this with [competitor] in the past, and both parties received a 15% lift in new subscribers.

  Any help is much appreciated.
