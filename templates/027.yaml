subject: You should blog about [guest post topic]

text: |
  [name], as an avid reader of [company], I would love to read about [guest post topic],
  and I think your other readers would as well.

  Your content on [existing post from their website 1],
  [existing post from their website 2], and [existing post from their website 3] is great,
  but I think you can tie it all together by blogging on [guest blog post topic].

  I know you are probably busy and won’t blog on it, so I’m going to make you an
  offer you can’t refuse. ;) How about I write it for you? Don’t worry, I’m a
  great blogger and have had my posts featured on [previous guest post URL 1]
  and [previous guest post URL 2].

  Let me know if you are interested. I already know your blogging style,
  plus I understand what your readers love… as I am one. ;-)

  Look forward to hearing from you,
  [my name]
