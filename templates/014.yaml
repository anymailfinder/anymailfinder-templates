subject: What do you think of [my competitors product]?
text: |
  Hi [name]

  Just ran across your website and noticed you were using [my competitors product].

  How are you liking it?

  I run a [service] called [my company]. It’s just like [my competitors product], only [key diffrentiator].

  If you’re up for it, I would love to jump on a quick call with you and get your
  opinion on how we could make [company] better (and see if it would make sense for us to work together).

  Would [time] be a good time for you?

  (if not, I’m flexible, just let me know)
